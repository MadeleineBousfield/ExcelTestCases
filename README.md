# Excel Test Cases

This project was completed as part of a Udemy course: [The Complete 2024 Software Testing Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/testerbootcamp/?couponCode=ST12MT030524).

This was an introduction to writing test cases, including writing prerequisites, test scripts and expected results. Example sign up and sign in pages for an app were provided, in order to identify and write as many valid and invalid test cases as possible.
